Hello,

I'm experiencing some difficulties with my UpWork account as it seems to have been blocked by Support, and I'm unsure of the reason behind it. I can't set up a new contract on UpWork.

Could you please contact me via email at dreamskydev@gmail.com? Alternatively, you can reach me on Skype at live:.cid.4d7236f36c739959.

Thank you. I'm keen on establishing a long-term working relationship with you.

Best regards,
Ivan
